While I haven't exactly figured out how to get the IAM permissions onto GitHub just yet, I think there are some preliminary benefits to keeping daily caching functions separate from the `dsyndicate - API`. This view might mature in time, but for now I want to migrate the existing drafted CRON jobs and implement the additional one we will need soonish!
